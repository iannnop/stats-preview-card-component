## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

A Mobile-first approach simplified my CSS and allowed me to see some flaws that I've made in my mobile design css because it completely breaks when I expand it into the desktop view. I definitely felt like I could have done this challenge better and more responsively with flex and flex-wrap. I will definitely look back at this challenge and fix up my code. I wanted to move on to more challenges, so I decided to settle with this solution.

### Continued development

In this challenge, I used photoshop to put the purple filter on the image that was originally grayscale. I think I'll try to incorporate more tools into these challenges so I can complete these designs more practically. I couldn't find a reasonable approach to adding a purple overlay over the image without simply making the html image a background-image property, so I just chose to use photoshop. In the next challenges, I want to quickly incorporate javascript into the projects.
